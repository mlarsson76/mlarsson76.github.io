I’m a senior tech leader with over 20 years of experience. I take on leading roles with responsibilities from initial strategies to successful implementation, including setting up governance processes.

I prefer working in an international environment where I can deliver business value with my team. I lead and support development and improvement projects, with on-site and offshore resources. I consider myself hands on and enjoy working with developers and architects to steer technical decisions in the right direction. 

I communicate effortlessly with technical experts as well as with business representatives.
