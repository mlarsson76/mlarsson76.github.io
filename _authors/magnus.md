I leverage my extensive tech experience to help companies achieve their digital goals and optimize their IT performance and security.
<br><br>
Previously, I was the CTO of Wineally, a global wine app, where I led the tech team in preparing for the global launch and maturing the product. I also contributed to the strategic planning and budgeting as a member of the management group. 
<br><br>
I also have experience as an IT architect, information security manager, and data protection manager at Inwido, a leading window and door company, where I oversaw the IT architecture, cybersecurity and GDPR compliance across the group.

With over 20 years of experience leading tech teams and implement strategies in international companies,  my mission is to deliver innovative and reliable solutions that create value and satisfaction for customers and stakeholders.
